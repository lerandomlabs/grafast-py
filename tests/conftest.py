"""Local conftest for grafast-py's own test suite.

These tests drive `GrafastExecutionContext` explicitly via
`execution_context_class=...`, so they are independent of the `GRAFAST` env var
and of the conformance-oracle root conftest. We put the repo root on `sys.path`
here so the suite is self-sufficient: a few tests import the `examples` package
(the demo schema/seed fixtures live there), and that must resolve without relying
on the (separate, conformance-only) root conftest.

The `GRAFAST_INLINE_RELATIONS=1` switch flips LATERAL inlining ON for this whole suite
via :func:`inline_relations_suite_toggle`, so the existing pg tests — every one of which
already asserts EXACT result data — become the broadest possible byte-identical oracle
for inlining. It is OFF by default, so a plain `uv run pytest tests` (and the conformance
run, which has its own conftest and never sets this) is unaffected.

The plan-caching + runtime-placeholder switches do the same via the sibling
:func:`cache_plans_suite_toggle`:

- `GRAFAST_CACHE_PLANS=1` forces `cache_plans=True` (and, because only a value-agnostic
  placeholder-bearing plan is cacheable across values, `placeholders=True` with it), so a
  cache hit changes only WHETHER planning re-runs — never the SQL or the data, hence the
  whole result-asserting suite stays byte-identical.
- `GRAFAST_PLACEHOLDERS=1` forces ONLY `placeholders=True`, so the per-argument variable
  provenance surface (and the placeholder dedup path) is exercised independently of caching:
  a host that does not call `pg_placeholder` still inlines literals exactly, so the suite
  again stays byte-identical (provenance is computed but unused). This lets the two knobs
  be A/B'd separately — placeholders can be exercised suite-wide without caching.

Both are OFF by default; a plain `uv run pytest tests` and the conformance run are
unaffected.

    forced on, proving they change only WHETHER planning re-runs (a cache hit) and WHICH

    Two independent env switches drive ONE merged config so they cannot fight over the shared

    - A test marked ``cache_off`` (it asserts the exact plan-BUILD count, which a hit reduces)
      is kept off the CACHE forcing — but placeholders, which never change the build count or
